- use un-`typedef`'d `struct`, `enum` and `union` types
- use `m6_` prefix
- use snake_case for variable and function names
- use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for macros and enum members
- use `!p` for null testing but `== 0` if the value being checked is numeric
- out parameters should appear as the last element of the parameter list
- obey 80 column limit
- wrap lines artificially only when statements cannot be otherwise decomposed
    - artificially wrapped lines should be indented twice
- avoid function calls in `if` and `for` conditions
- allow for single-line `if`, `for` and `while`
- unbraced `if`, `for` and `while` only allowed on a single-line
- always place opening brace on the same line as the construct it is attached
- single line switch cases are not allowed and must always be braced
- log strings are not capitalised
- initializer braces should have internal spaces. i.e. `{ 0 }` not `{0}`
- functions performing operations on an object should take that object first
- function declarations spanning multiple lines:
    - should place the parameter list starting from the second line
    - should have a line break before the function body, if present
- function signatures should be formatted identically between decl. and impl.
